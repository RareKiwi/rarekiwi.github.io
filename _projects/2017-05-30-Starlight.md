## About

(WIP)
Media Design School
Student led/created 8-week project.  
Top placement within the class by review team from across the film VFX industry.

## Water

I created the simulations for the water effects as well as the initial Nuke node setup to integrate it onto the matte paintings.

## Lighting

Most shots were previs or finalized by myself.  
I did RnD for the star effect.

## Rendering

I setup all the render scenes which included layer separation of characters, back grounds and hero objects for compositing in Nuke.  
AOV layers were also rendered for expanded Nuke options.  

## Modeling and Texturing

Boat, House interior, Bookshelves, Various

## Producer

I created a maya python GUI for our pipeline which handled exports for version publishing.
Each role had specific scripts to automate the process as much as possible, provided a naming and tag scheme.
