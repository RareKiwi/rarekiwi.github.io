## About

ISMC is the Insurgency Sandstorm Modding Collaboration project. It is one of the largest community mods for Insurgency: Sandstorm.  
It is a collection of theater mods which adds weapons, attachments, cosmetics, new factions, vehicles, fire supports and more.

## My Work

During the development of the mod I provided blueprint features and RnD for model rigging and other problem solving. Some of that blueprinting included;
* Toggleable sights )before the offical version was added to the base game)
* Canted weapon aiming
* Procedural weapon skins

Following the releases of ISMC, the team moved onto other projects (or got jobs :D ).  
I took up this version of the mod and provided support for game updates and fixed various long standing quality of life issues with the mod.  
Some of the work I performed was;

* Size reduction: Thousands of files and blueprints were optimised based on usage to cut the file size to a third of the original.
* Split mods: The game play elements such as blueprints were isolated from the mostly non-updating resources which improved mod update delivery extensively.
* Theater fixes for "legacy" features. Bots equipment and thousands of load out fixes.
* Movement tweaks were split into optional mutators.
* Firesupport availability was made configurable.
* Thermal vision was improved with custom depth shaders.
* Certain equipment can be enabled/disabled by tags.
* Scope pictures were fixed or improved.
* Many small QOL features like repeated commander voicelines were muted.
