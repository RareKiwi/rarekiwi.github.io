## About

Tappy is a multiplayer gameplay addon for Ready or Not.  It expands players interaction options with their team-mates.  
Extensive configuration is available for players via an in-game menu.

### Tap  

Allows users to interact with others if close enough.  
After interacting, a "ready" voice line is played and a soft directional indicator is shown on the edge of the receiving players display. This allows for non verbal or non-perceptional tactics.  
  
### Point  

Using the same key or another re-mappable key players can perform two types of pings that others can see.  

A short press will pulse a location with a location based ripple distortion effect.  
A long hold of the key will leave a short duration circular outline with a colour based on the inverted screen colour.  

Both effects are attached to which ever object or AI the ping is projected on, so bots can be indicated to be secured or doors to be opened.  
Both effects are depth checked so players behind walls only see local pings, improving immersion.

### Incremental Doors

Using functions exposed to blueprints, I also added the ability to incrementally peek doors based on two input keys such as mouse-wheel up and mouse-wheel down.
This allows players who are more thorough to clear room threshold more carefully as well as enabling players to pull doors towards themselves, which isn't currently a feature of the game.

### Test Doors

Using functions exposed to blueprints, and optionally the same key as the tap and point input, players can check the locked state of doors without need to open or peek it first.  
For multiplayer, a voice-line is played for nearby players, indicating if locked, unlocked or jammed.
