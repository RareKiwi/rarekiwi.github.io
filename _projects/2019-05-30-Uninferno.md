## About

This is a project from **2020**. Nicknamed **Uninferno**. *(Unreal Engine Inferno)*.  
  
It was a remake of the level **Inferno** from *Counter Strike: Global Offensive* in Unreal Engine 4 using Quixel assets and Maya for modelling.  
  
This was the first project I used to learn UE4 workflows and game art/gameplay/baked lighting coming from Maya/VFX studies originally.  
  
It was built in the Insurgency: Sandstorm mod tools, so the level design was planned and adjusted to fit the larger coop game-modes.
That included extending the map and designing interiors that matched the building shapes of the original level.

### Gameplay

As a part of the remake, some layout changes were needed to fit Sandstorms checkpoint coop mode. The mode has players moving from objective to objective, being held back by AI along the way.  
There's a general rule of how far apart each of these points should be as well as the routes between them for players to enjoy and AI to utilise. Many out-of-bounds areas were opened up and made into playable spaces. 
Additionally interiors were created to link these paths together as well as provide cover for the defensive phase of the objectives, 
which has waves of AI attack the players along with fire supports such as mortars and helicopters.

### Night Lighting

Night lighting scenarios are available to server hosts as an alternative way to play maps. Lights positions in day aren't just aesthetic details. They are the logical sources of light in the night scenarios.
