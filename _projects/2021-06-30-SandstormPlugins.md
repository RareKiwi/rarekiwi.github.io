## About

A number of server orientated mods for Insurgency: Sandstorm.

### Round Progress

Provides save states based on objective progress.  
If all players are eliminated or the time lapses, players can be progressed to the latest state at the beginning of the next round.

### Health Regen

Provides multiple forms of health regeneration.  
* Timer based regen with a configurable damage buffer delay.  
* Objective completion based healling  
  
Health maximums can also be tweaked.

### Map Vote Labels

Provides customisation for server admins for the after match map voting options.  
Titles, gamemodes and descriptions can be edited to help show players extra settings.

### Custom Objectives

Changes the gameplay of the defence phase of objectives by removing the proximity requirement.  
Instead players must clear the objective after the defense timer has completed. Players now fail if their lives are depleted.
