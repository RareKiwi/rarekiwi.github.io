## About

This mod was created to edit the in game post process volumes with your own tweaks without the need for external post processing injectors.  
While the mod was created for Ready or Not, the interface could be added to any UE4 project, with the design matching the in editor post process details panel.  

Collections can be created, saved and shared as standard Unreal Engine .sav files.
Presets for PP settings can be save and reused by multiple volumes.

Thermals and night-vision shown are post-process materials from Insurgency: Sandstorm or ISMC

For colour wheels the excellent [UMG Color Pickers](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/umg-color-pickers-01) was used.  
Additionally post process materials such as NVGs or Thermals can be loaded and toggled with a keypress.  
Blueprints are provided to add characters into the custom depth or custom stencil buffer for effects like thermal vision.
