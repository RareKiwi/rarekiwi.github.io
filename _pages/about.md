In my spare time I create modifications for games involving 3d art and UE4 blueprinting.  
  
I always been passionate about level design, always tinkering with level editors from Warcraft 3, Cryengine, Source games and so on.  
While a majority of my time is spent on level design, I also enjoy game scripting to improve player experiences or to expand a games features as well as technical problem solving for myself or others.  
  
I really enjoy being able to support other mod creators in communities such as Insurgency: Sandstorm or Ready or Not, so that they can get started and see their own projects come to life.
